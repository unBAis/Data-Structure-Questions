# The heroes start fighting villains one by one in the same order, first villain 1 then villain 2 and so on. 
# It is might be possible that before defeating all the villains, 
# all the heroes are defeated. 
# Therefore, to ensure the victory of the heroes, you want to remove some villains from the front.

# Your task is to find the minimum number of villains you need to remove
# from the front such that the victory of the heroes is guaranteed.

# Note: If in the last battle, both the hero and villain are defeated and 
# no more heroes or villains remain, it would still be considered a 
# victory since all the villains are defeated.
