#the following function takes in the two lists input to return the winner of the game of a card game explained as follows:
# two people have same number of cards
# at random someone will call even or odd
#if even is called then first card will be flipped and each person will subtract the other players card from own card and add the number to their own score.
# if odd is called then one card will be removed and the next card will be flipped and the scoring will be same as described in even flipping.
#thereafter alternativly card will be flipped and removed and the score will be added same as decribe above.
#when the cards are finished the player with the max score will win.
